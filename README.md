The following assignment is based on the database environment proposed in the Week One Individual Assignment.

Perform a logical design on the proposed database environment without going through the full normalization process.  Include the identification of all entities and attributes associated with the environment.

Use a 2-page memo to document your logical design including the process you went through.

Discuss the process you went through to select the appropriate data types, primary and foreign keys, and other constraints that are necessary to maintain the integrity of the database.

Create a detailed ERD using the data specifications from the logical design. Use Microsoft® Visio® or another tool to create this diagram. One alternative is to create a free account to access LucidChart, a Visio compaible tool (www.lucidchart.com)
